## Machine Learning Fundamentals to Advanced Concepts with Scikit-Learn

This project presents a structured exploration of machine learning using built-in datasets like the Iris, California Housing, and Wine datasets. It is designed to help learners understand the progression from fundamental ML concepts to advanced techniques. Each model is trained, evaluated, and visualized to demonstrate its utility and interpretability.

* This section illustrates practical use of regression in predicting real-valued outcomes.

#### 3. **Advanced ML Techniques (Wine Dataset)**

* Implemented polynomial feature transformation to capture non-linear relationships.
* Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal model performance.
* Explored ensemble models.
* Interpreted model predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to gain insights into feature contributions.
